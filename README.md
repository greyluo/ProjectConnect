ProjectConnect is a web-based platform designed to connect students with academic, research, or extracurricular projects that align with their interests, skills, and goals. The platform helps students discover and join their preferred projects led by other students, faculty members, or external organizations. 


## Some key features of ProjectConnect include:

1. Interest-based project matching: Students create a profile outlining their interests, skills, and academic background. The platform uses an AI-driven algorithm to recommend projects that align with their preferences.
2. Project creation and collaboration: Users can create new projects and define the roles, skills, and expertise needed for the project. Students interested in the project can apply to join or be invited by the project creator.
3. Progress tracking and milestones: ProjectConnect includes a project management feature that enables users to set milestones, track progress, and collaborate on tasks. Students can gain a sense of accomplishment as they complete milestones and contribute to the project's success.
4. Skill development and endorsements: As students participate in projects, they can develop and showcase their skills. Other users can endorse their skills, strengthening their profiles and increasing their chances of being invited to future projects.
5. Networking and community building: Students can connect with peers, faculty, and industry professionals involved in projects, fostering a sense of community and creating valuable networking opportunities.


ProjectConnect combines the elements of project discovery, collaboration, and skill development to create a unique platform that helps students engage in meaningful projects while enhancing their learning experience.
